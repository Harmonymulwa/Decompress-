# lz78
The LZ78 Compression/Decompression System is a very simple software built in C to compress and decompress generic data. It is based on the LZ78 lossless data compression algorithm published by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv. It consists of a single executable program which can be used both as compressor and decompressor depending on the command line options specified.

The LZ78 Compression/Decompression System has been developed as final project for the exam of Advanced Topics in Computer Systems and Networks in the computer engineering masterâ€™s degree program at University of Pisa.
